# Noise-Cancellation-using-adaptive-filter

This Project involves the study of the principles of
Adaptive Noise Cancellation (ANC). Adaptive noise Cancellation is
an alternative technique of estimating signals corrupted by additive
noise or interference. In this, we donâ€™t need a priori estimates of
signal or noise, levels of noise rejection are attainable that would be
difficult or impossible to achieve by other signal processing
methods of removing noise. This approach needs two inputs - a
reference input containing the corrupted signal and a reference
input containing noise correlated in some unknown way with the
primary noise. The primary input is adaptively filtered and
subtracted from the reference input to obtain the signal estimate.
